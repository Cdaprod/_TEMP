our builtins in pkg/ 

Registry builtins for:

api.go(integration ops for adding deployed applications, services, external “plugins” which we would call our modular components) git.go(accounts/orgs/keys, repos, projects, gists, actions, runs, runners with repo data using gh api) docker.go(containers, images, volumes, ports, networks, services, contexts, whatever makes it more capable of seamlessness)

We need to shrink the actual implementation of builtins and put it in builtins.go and move it out from whatever .go file it’s currently implement in
